# eck-diagnostics
Diagnostic tooling for ECK installations

[![Go](https://github.com/elastic/eck-diagnostics/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/elastic/eck-diagnostics/actions/workflows/go.yml)

## Installation

Go to the [releases](https://github.com/elastic/eck-diagnostics/releases) page and download the version matching your architecture. Unpack the gzip'ed tar archive and put the binary included in the archive somewhere in your PATH.


## Running

Just execute the binary. On macOS versions with Gatekeeper enabled you have to explicitly allow the execution the first time round, as described in this [support article](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491) (in the section "If you want to open an app that hasnâ€™t been notarized or is from an unidentified developer"). 

To run diagnostics, you need to specify at least the workload resource namespace(s). The operator namespace is set by default to the `elastic-system` namespace, where the ECK operator typically resides.

For example, to run diagnostics for resource namespaces `a` and `b`:
```shell
eck-diagnostics -r a,b
```

A full list of available flags is reproduced here and is also printed when calling the `eck-diagnostics` binary with the `--help` or `-h` flag:

```
Usage:
  eck-diagnostics [flags]

Flags:
      --diagnostic-image string        Diagnostic image to be used for stack diagnostics, see run-stack-diagnostics (default "docker.elastic.co/eck-dev/support-diagnostics:8.1.4")
      --eck-version string             ECK version in use, will try to autodetect if not specified
  -h, --help                           help for eck-diagnostics
      --kubeconfig string              optional path to kube config, defaults to $HOME/.kube/config
  -o, --operator-namespaces strings    Comma-separated list of namespace(s) in which operator(s) are running (default [elastic-system])
      --output-directory string        Path where to output diagnostic results
  -r, --resources-namespaces strings   Comma-separated list of namespace(s) in which resources are managed
      --run-stack-diagnostics          Run diagnostics on deployed Elasticsearch clusters and Kibana instances, requires deploying diagnostic Pods into the cluster (default true)
      --verbose                        Verbose mode
```

## Information collected by eck-diagnostics

The eck-diagnostics retrieves Kubernetes API server resources and log files and, unless disabled, it runs Elastic [support-diagnostics](https://github.com/elastic/support-diagnostics) on Elasticsearch and Kibana instances installed in the namespaces indicated by the `-r, --resources-namespaces` flag.

The following Kubernetes resources are retrieved from the cluster being diagnosed:

### Global resources
* Kubernetes server version
* Kubernetes nodes
* PodSecurityPolicy
* ClusterRole

### In all operator and workload resource namespaces 
* StatefulSet
* Pod
* Service
* ConfigMap
* Event
* NetworkPolicy
* ControllerRevision
* Secret (metadata only)

### In the workload resources namespaces
In addition to the resources mentioned above, the following Kubernetes resources are retrieved:
* ReplicaSet
* Deployment
* DaemonSet
* PersistentVolume
* PersistentVolumeClaim
* Endpoint

The ECK related custom resources are included in those namespaces as well: 
* Agent
* ApmServer
* Beat
* ElasticMapsServer
* Elasticsearch
* EnterpriseSearch
* Kibana

### Logs
In the operator namespaces (`-o, --operator-namespaces`) all logs are collected, while in the workload resource namespaces only logs from Pods managed by ECK are collected.
