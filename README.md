# eck-diagnostics
Diagnostic tooling for ECK installations

[![Go](https://github.com/elastic/eck-diagnostics/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/elastic/eck-diagnostics/actions/workflows/go.yml)

## Installation

Go to the [releases](https://github.com/elastic/eck-diagnostics/releases) page and download the version matching your architecture. Unpack the gzip'ed tar archive and put the binary included in the archive somewhere in your PATH.


## Running

Just execute the binary. On macOS versions with Gatekeeper enabled you have to explicitly allow the execution the first time round, as described in this [support article](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491) (in the section "If you want to open an app that hasnâ€™t been notarized or is from an unidentified developer"). 

To run diagnostics, you need to specify at least the workload resource namespace(s). The operator namespace is set by default to the `elastic-system` namespace, where the ECK operator typically resides.

For example, to run diagnostics for resource namespaces `a` and `b`:
```shell
eck-diagnostics -r a,b
```

A full list of available flags is reproduced here and is also printed when calling the `eck-diagnostics` binary with the `--help` or `-h` flag:

```
Usage:
  eck-diagnostics [flags]

Flags:
      --diagnostic-image string              Diagnostic image to be used for stack diagnostics, see run-stack-diagnostics (default "docker.elastic.co/eck-dev/support-diagnostics:8.4.3")
      --eck-version string                   ECK version in use, will try to autodetect if not specified
  -f, --filters strings                      Comma-separated list of filters in format "type=name". ex: elasticsearch=my-cluster (Supported types [agent apm beat elasticsearch enterprisesearch kibana maps])
  -h, --help                                 help for eck-diagnostics
      --kubeconfig string                    optional path to kube config, defaults to $HOME/.kube/config
  -o, --operator-namespaces strings          Comma-separated list of namespace(s) in which operator(s) are running (default [elastic-system])
      --output-directory string              Path where to output diagnostic results
  -n, --output-name string                   Name of the output diagnostics file (default "eck-diagnostic-2023-02-21T09-16-17.zip")
  -r, --resources-namespaces strings         Comma-separated list of namespace(s) in which resources are managed
      --run-agent-diagnostics                Run diagnostics on deployed Elastic Agents. Warning: credentials will not be redacted and appear as plain text in the archive
      --run-stack-diagnostics                Run diagnostics on deployed Elasticsearch clusters and Kibana instances, requires deploying diagnostic Pods into the cluster (default true)
      --stack-diagnostics-timeout duration   Maximum time to wait for Elaticsearch and Kibana diagnostics to complete (default 5m0s)
      --verbose                              Verbose mode
```

## Information collected by eck-diagnostics

The eck-diagnostics retrieves Kubernetes API server resources and log files and, unless disabled, it runs Elastic [support-diagnostics](https://github.com/elastic/support-diagnostics) on Elasticsearch and Kibana instances installed in the namespaces indicated by the `-r, --resources-namespaces` flag. In addition it can optionally run the [diagnostic subcommand](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-cmd-options.html#elastic-agent-diagnostics-command) on all running Elastic Agents. Please note that credentials are not redacted in the Elastic Agent diagnostics and may appear in plain text inside the diagnostics archive. Elastic Agent diagnostics are therefore disabled by default.

The following Kubernetes resources are retrieved from the cluster being diagnosed:

### Global resources
* Kubernetes server version
* Kubernetes nodes
* PodSecurityPolicy
* ClusterRole
* ClusterRoleBindings
* StorageClass

### In all operator and workload resource namespaces 
* StatefulSet
* Pod
* Service
* ConfigMap
* Event
* NetworkPolicy
* ControllerRevision
* Secret (metadata only)
* ServiceAccount

### In the workload resources namespaces
In addition to the resources mentioned above, the following Kubernetes resources are retrieved:
* ReplicaSet
* Deployment
* DaemonSet
* PersistentVolume
* PersistentVolumeClaim
* Endpoint

The ECK related custom resources are included in those namespaces as well: 
* Agent
* ApmServer
* Beat
* ElasticMapsServer
* Elasticsearch
* EnterpriseSearch
* Kibana

### Logs
In the operator namespaces (`-o, --operator-namespaces`) all logs are collected, while in the workload resource namespaces only logs from Pods managed by ECK are collected.

## Filtering collected resources

The resources in the specified namespaces that are collected by eck-diagnostics can be filtered with the `-f, --filters` flag.

### Usage Example

The following example will run the diagnostics for Elastic resources in namespace `a`, and will only return resources associated with either an Elasticsearch cluster named `mycluster` or a Kibana instance named `my-kb`.

```shell
eck-diagnostics -r a -f "elasticsearch=mycluster" -f "kibana=my-kb"
```

### Filtered resources

Only a certain number of Kubernetes resources support filtering when filtering by an Elastic custom resource.  Along with the named Elastic custom resource type, the following resources will be returned that are associated:

* ConfigMap
* ControllerRevision
* Deployment
* DaemonSet
* Endpoint
* Pod
* PersistentVolumeClaim
* Replicaset
* Service
* StatefulSet

The following resources are returned unfiltered:

* Event
* NetworkPolicy
* PersistentVolume
* ServiceAccount
* Secret (metadata only)


### Using custom ECK installation methods

If you are using your own installation manifests or Helm chart make sure the metadata on the Pods running the operator matches the metadata used by Elastic's official installation manifests. Specifically ensure that you have a `control-plane: elastic-operator` label on the ECK operator StatefulSet or Deployment and its Pods. This ensures that eck-diagnostics can successfully extract logs and version information from those Pods.
