# eck-diagnostics
Diagnostic tooling for ECK installations

[![Go](https://github.com/elastic/eck-diagnostics/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/elastic/eck-diagnostics/actions/workflows/go.yml)

## Installation

Go to the [releases](https://github.com/elastic/eck-diagnostics/releases) page and download the version matching your architecture. Unpack the gzip'ed tar archive and put the binary included in the archive somewhere in your PATH.


## Running

Just execute the binary. On macOS versions with Gatekeeper enabled you have to explicitly allow the execution the first time round, as described in this [support article](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491) (in the section "If you want to open an app that hasnâ€™t been notarized or is from an unidentified developer"). 

By default the tool will run diagnostics for the `elastic-system` namespace, where the ECK operator typically resides, and the `default` namespace.

To run diagnostics, for example, for namespaces `a` and `b` instead:
```shell
eck-diagnostics -r a,b
```

A full list of available options is reproduced here and is also printed when calling the `eck-diagnostics` binary with the `--help` or `-h` flag:

```

  eck-diagnostics [flags]
